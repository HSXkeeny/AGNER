# AGNER

This is the AGNER model repository. We provide detailed data set processing, model training and prediction codes. We hope you will like our work:

For the private dataset AG-NER, due to confidentiality policy restrictions, we do not provide a public link for the time being. Please contact us if you have any needs.

Download the data set and conduct experiments according to the relevant settings of the data loader.

## 2. Set up

We provide two settings for supervised learning and continuous learning. For each part of the model, please see the AGNER file. Main.py is used for training and evaluation. Please replace the file location with your own file location.
